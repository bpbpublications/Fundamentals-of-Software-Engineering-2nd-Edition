# Singleton Pattern Example in Python for Database Connection
class DatabaseConnection:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(DatabaseConnection, cls).__new__(cls)
            # Initialize the database connection here
            cls._instance.connection = cls.connect_to_db()
        return cls._instance

    @staticmethod
    def connect_to_db():
        print("Connecting to database...")
        # Code to establish a database connection
        return "DatabaseConnectionObject"

# Usage
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1.connection)  # Output: DatabaseConnectionObject
print(db1 is db2)      # Output: True, demonstrating that both db1 and db2 are the same instance.
